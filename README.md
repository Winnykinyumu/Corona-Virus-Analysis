### Project Overview
---
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact and spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) between January 2020 and June 2021 across most countries worldwide. The analysis aims to provide insights into the patterns and trends associated with the pandemic, including case numbers, mortality rates and recoveries.
### Data Source
---
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "corona_Virus_Dataset.CSV" file, containing detailed information for each country's record.
### Tools Used
---
- Excel- Data cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server -Data Analysis [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
### Data cleaning/preparation
---
Cleaning the dataset entailed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Identifying and imputing missing values.
- **Write a code to check NULL values**
  ```SQL
  select COUNT(*) as number_of_nulls
  from [Corona virus Analysis].dbo.[Corona Virus Dataset]
  WHERE Province IS NULL AND Country_Region IS NULL AND Latitude IS NULL AND Longitude IS NULL AND Date IS NULL AND Confirmed IS NULL AND Deaths IS NULL AND Recovered IS NULL
  ```
  - **Results**

### Key Insights
---
- The pandemic occurred between 2020-01-22 and 2021-06-13.
- December 2020 presented to have the highest average confirmed cases,average deaths and average recovered cases.
- Turkey presented to have the highest number of confirmed cases.
- Gambia presented to have the lowest number of death cases.
- The top 5 countries with the highest number of recovered cases were Turkey, India, Brazil, US and Columbia, which would suggest effective treatment measures and healthcare
  delivery practices.
- There was a higher variance in the spread of corona virus in relation to the total cases confirmed, total deaths and total recovered. This suggested that the situation was less 
  controlled and control measures such as social distancing were not effective.
- The variance gap shed light on the differences in healthcare access and treatment measures across regions which led to delayed recovery.

### Conclusion/Recommendation
---
- Noting the high variance in the confirmed and death cases, there will be a need for implementing uniform reporting standards in future, to  ensure consistency in the
    data collection and help in minimizing errors.
- In future, there will be a need to bolster healthcare resources for them to be well-equipped to handle surges in cases, which would hasten recovery . This would apply in
    a case of an health pandemic.
