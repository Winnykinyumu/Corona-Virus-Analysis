# Corona-Virus-Analysis

### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact and spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) between January 2020 and June 2021 across most countries worldwide. The analysis aims to provide insights into the patterns and trends associated with the pandemic, including case numbers, mortality rates and recoveries.
### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "corona_Virus_Dataset.CSV" file, containing detailed information for each country's record.
### Tools Used
- Excel- Data cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server -Data Analysis [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
### Data cleaning/preparation
Cleaning the dataset entailed:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Identifying and imputing missing values.
3. Identifying and removing duplicates.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA entailed answering key questions such as;
To avoid any errors, check missing value / null value 
-- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values

--Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 

-- Q3. check total number of rows

-- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset

-- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered

-- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month 

-- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month

-- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case

-- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case

-- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case
